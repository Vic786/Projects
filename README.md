#Data Science Projects by Wiktoria Plechta

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing selected data science research projects completed as part of my studies at the Silesian University of Technology. These projects explore topics such as machine learning, explainable AI, time series forecasting, and model optimization. Each project includes code and research paper submitted to international conferences.
